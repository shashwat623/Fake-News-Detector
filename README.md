# Fake-News-Detector

Fake news with a lot of click baits has become a major problem in today's world. This is a python based fake news detector biult with the help of a deep learning model(implemented via keras) and using the built in TF-IDF library for numerical statistic which helps us to  reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.
The program will classify each testing article into one of the following categories based on how relevant the article is compared to it's headline. The categories are:-
1. Unrelated
2. Discuss
3. Agree
4. Disagree
